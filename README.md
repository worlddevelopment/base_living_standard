Base living standard set.
===
Basic components to bring living standard up to an acceptable level globally.

For a different climate/geography, different building blocks may be required. (A branch or yet other repository may be created, currently favouring branches as it reduces redundancy and as this is a wrapper repository, i.e. a module collection, plays for branches.)



Goals
---
Check the folders in the branch for your climate/geography for a way how these goals may be achieved.

In the order of importance:
###Water (drinking)

###Heating/Cooling (depending on climate)

###Education (Comes education, comes food. Comes education, come equal rights (man women friendly animals, fungi and plants).)
Example technology: *Morse learning apparatus* by Roman Black. Adapt for learning English, then provide device for showing videos of edible things, permies.com and other permaculture and survival videos already help a lot).

###Food

###Cleaning (health, clothes, electricity or cooking goods endure longer)

###Electricity


More to be discussed by the world population.

World development:
---
*For the goals we bake, the best and simplest (yet ethical) solutions we take.*


World development goals
---

* A green, ecological world. Environment friendly.
* Improve living standard of the world. => Less pain. Terrorists also might have a potentially more difficult life recruiting poor people if they know we care for them (open technology, for a better world).
